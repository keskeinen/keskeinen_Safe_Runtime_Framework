# keskeinen_Safe_Runtime_Framework
This project demonstrates the refactoring of a legacy industrial WinForm framework (common in .NET 4.5) into a modern architecture using .NET 8/9. The primary goal is to resolve long-standing Memory Leak issues, reduce System Coupling, and enhance System Safety through a strict initialization sequence managed by Dependency Injection (DI).
